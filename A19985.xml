            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>My former ſorrow thus abated then, and hauing in this ſort recovered my ſelfe (if yet I may be ſaid to haue recouered my ſelfe, who am often hereafter to meditate not onely of my private loſſe, but of our publike calamitie too) what remaineth, but I now reſume my firſt and formoſt reſolution of ſpeaking vnto you in this kind, that ſo long at the leaſt as this ſhall happen of ſpeaking in this kind here vnto you, my thoughts may bee ſomewhat ſetled, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies intentiue on HER, for loſſe of whom I cannot but ſee a ſea of croſſes to my ſelfe, or not alwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue on HIM, for loſſe of whom I well may feare a world of croſſes to our Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Come we then to the matter in hand, and firſt by way of <hi>Preamble,</hi> let mee this firſt time entreat vnto you of certain words of the Prophet <hi>David's,</hi> as they are written in his foure and thirtieth Pſalme, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:25448:7"/> verſe of that Pſalme. The words are theſe:
<q>Come yee children and harken vnto mee, I will teach you the feare of the Lord.</q> In which words for my better proceeding, let mee obſerue vnto you theſe foure points. Firſt an Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Come:</hi> Secondly, the parties invited, <hi>yee children:</hi> Thirdly, the duty to be performed on their parts, <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto me:</hi> Fourthly, and laſtly the dutie on his part who did invite them, <hi>I will teach you the feare of the Lord.</hi> I wil be very briefe in all foure; &amp; firſt in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation <hi>Come,</hi> which is (you ſee) but a word, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but a word ſhal you ſee to be ſaid of it, <hi>Come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Memorable is that in S. <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpell of one that made a great ſupper, &amp; bade many, and ſent his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant at ſupper time to ſay to them that were bidden, <hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Come: for all things are now ready.</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Luk 14.17.</note> You are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the excuſes were made by a many of them at that time, nor in how little ſteed thoſe excuſes then ſtood them, nor of the iuſt anger of the Maſter of the houſe conceaued therevpon. <hi>I,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſay vnto you, that none of thoſe men which were bidden ſhall tast of my ſupper.</hi> As if he had ſaid: they ſhould not haue a bit of it to ſaue their liues, no not to ſaue their ſouls. So that in this one onely word, <hi>Come,</hi> is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all this: <hi>Firſt,</hi> God himſelfe inviting vs: <hi>Secondly,</hi> inviting vs by his ſervants: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> no excuſe to ſerue the turne: <hi>Fourthly,</hi> his indignation and wrath, if ſo be we come not: <hi>Fiftly</hi> and laſtly, if we come, his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming all and every of vs. And thus you ſee how

Thirdly <hi>Feare</hi> is taken for a free voluntary reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which Inferiors ſhew to their Superiors, making them carefull to obey &amp; fearefull to offend, as Rom. 13.7, <hi>Tribute to whom ye owe tribute, cuſtome to whom cuſtome, feare to whom feare.</hi> And that <hi>fear</hi> there ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of is fearefulneſſe to offend, not <hi>formidine poenae</hi> (as ſpeakes the Poet) <hi>becauſe of puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t inſuing, but vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis amore, for loue of goodnes.</hi> You know whoſe ſaying it was, <hi>Oderunt peccare boni virtutis amore:</hi>

            <p>Fourthly <hi>Feare</hi> is taken for an holy affection of the hart awing vs &amp; making vs loath to diſpleaſe God by ſinne in reſpect of his gracious goodnes and mercies, and for a loue we beare to righteouſnes, as Pſa. 130.4. <hi>There is mercy with thee, therefore ſhalt thou be feared.</hi> Now this is that <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> that beginning &amp; end of wiſdome ſo much ſpoken of in the Scriptures. <hi>The beginning,</hi> as Pſalm. 111.10. <hi>The feare of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdome: The end,</hi> as Eccles. 12.13. <hi>Let vs heare the end of all, Feare God, and keepe his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</hi> Very excellent things throughout the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſpoken of this Feare. As Pſal. 25.11. <hi>What ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is he that feareth the Lorde, him ſhall he teach in the way that he ſhall chooſe:</hi> and Pſal. 145.19, <hi>He will fulfill the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of them that feare him:</hi> and Pſalme, 115, 13, <hi>He ſhall bleſſe them that feare the Lord both ſmall and great.</hi> I but <hi>lentum eſt dabit, dat</hi> ſaith the<note n="u" place="margin">Senec.

            <p>I haue reckoned vnto you foure waies how Feare is to be taken. There is a fift, and a ſixt way to, of both which in a word. Fiftly then <hi>Feare</hi> is taken for a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in the hart of the wicked dreading God as a Iudge, and fearing to offend him only in regarde of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that may inſue. Of this the Apoſtle <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. 1. Ioh. 4.18. <hi>Feare</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath painefulnes,</hi> or as it is in our new Tranſlation, <hi>Feare hath torment.</hi> And I ſay only in regard of puniſhment, for that the Godly in regard of puniſhment may bee fearefull to offend, but not in regard of puniſhment onely. In this caſe<note n="x" place="margin">Aug. Tom. <hi>9.</hi> in <hi>1.</hi> epiſt. Ioan. p. <hi>436.</hi>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:25448:29"/> all things; that is, he made all things by his <hi>word.</hi> So the Prophet <hi>David,</hi>
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſ. 148.4.</note> 
               <hi>He spake the word, and they were made, he commanded and they were created,</hi> ſpeaking of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: and in another place of the Earth, <hi>He ſpake,</hi> ſaith he,<note n="t" place="margin">Pſ. 33.9.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly concerning the HOLY GHOST it is aſmuch as if the Apoſtle had here ſaid, the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> &amp; then ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Sonne</hi> are <hi>Holy</hi> both, and both are <hi>Spirits,</hi> a queſtion might be asked how this title <hi>Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> comes ſo peculiarly to be appropriated onely to the third Perſon. The anſwer is herevnto that the Father, and the Sonne are in reſpect of their<note n="u" place="margin">M. Perkins on the Creed p <hi>565</hi>
               </note> natures as well to be tearmed <hi>Holy</hi> indeed, as is the third Perſon in Trinity, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Howbeit the third Perſon is called <hi>Holy,</hi> for that beſides the holineſſe of nature, his office is to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Church of God, to whom it agreeth in ſpeciall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and after a peculiar ſort ſo to doe. For where the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſanctifieth by the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> the <hi>Sonne</hi> from the <hi>Father,</hi> and by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſanctifieth from the <hi>Father</hi> and from the <hi>Sonne</hi> by himſelfe immediatly, and in this reſpect is the third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon tearmed <hi>Holy.</hi> Again, he is tearmed a <hi>Spirit</hi> not onely becauſe his nature is ſpirituall (for in that reſpect both the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Sonne</hi> are <hi>Spirits</hi> too) but becauſe he is ſpired or breathed from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Sonne</hi> in that he proceedeth from both, howſoever the<note n="x" place="margin">Vid Zanch. de trib Eloh. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>8</hi>

               <hi>Greekes</hi> at this day mainly erre in this point. But thus much of the words, now of the conſequence therevpon.</p>
            <p>The Conſequence therevpon is this, that howſoever there is but <hi>One God</hi> as appeareth by theſe wordes, <hi>And theſe three are one:</hi> yet is there a Trinitie in this <hi>One</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they are <hi>Three</hi> to, according to the ſelfe ſame words. For if it may be ſaid, and ſaid truely, <hi>Theſe three are one,</hi> then may it be as truely ſaid, and ſo it is of all true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>This one is three.</hi> It remaineth then to be declared how they are one, how three, according to that of Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:25448:30"/> in our Church Liturgy, <hi>The Catholike faith is this, that we worſhip one God in Trinitie, and Trinitie in Vnitie: neither confounding the Perſons, nor dividing the ſubſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>God</hi> is <hi>One</hi> we haue many places in holy Scripture for proofe thereof, as Deut. 4.35, <hi>

For firſt concerning Heaven, he hath cauſed therein the bright-ſome riſing of the Sunne, the ſhining globe of the Moone he hath filled with augmentation to lighten the night withall, as alſo with the many beames, and brightneſſe of the Starres, all which he would that with orderly procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings they ſhould compaſſe the whole world, making for the benefit of mankind both daies, and moneths, and yeares, and ſignes, and times, and commodities. Secondly concerning the Earth, he hath made therein the Hills, and Mountaines of

He hath made ſtable, ſure, &amp; ſtrong, the bodies of Oak and Timber, for the ſervice of Man too, he hath brought Corn out of the earth, and made it fit for meat, he hath vncloſed the heads of Fountaines, and powred forth the ſame into the glyding Rivers. Afterwards that he might procure delight vnto the eie, he hath cloathed the Earth with ſundry kinds of flowers. Thirdly concerning the Sea, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it was exceeding admirable both for quantity and vtility, yet hath he formed and framed therein divers &amp; ſundry kinds of Beaſts, ſome of leſſe, ſome of a greater Bulcke, all teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto vs the wiſdome of their Maker in respect of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of their making.

After all theſe things rehearſed he hath placed Man over the world, made in trueth at firſt to the ſimilitude of God: to whom he hath given a mind, and reaſon, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that he might imitate the ſame God.

               </note> ſaith Reverend Hooker, <hi>is a word which Art hath deviſed thereby to ſever and diſtinguiſh that ſocietie of Men which profeſſeth the true Religion, from the reſt which profeſſe it not. There haue beene in the world from the very firſt foundation thereof but three Religions:</hi> PAGA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISME, <hi>which lived in the blindneſſe of corrupt, and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved nature;</hi> IVDAISME <hi>embracing the Law which refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Heatheniſh impietie, and taught Salvation to be looked for through one whom God in the laſt daies would ſend &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt to be Lord of all; Finally</hi> CHRISTIAN BELEEFE <hi>which yeeldeth obedience to the Gospell of Ieſus Chriſt, and acknowledgeth him the Saviour whom God did promiſe. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then that the Church is a name which Art hath given to Profeſſors of true Religion; as they which will define a Man are to paſſe by thoſe qualities wherein one Man doth excell another, and to take only thoſe eſſentiall properties, whereby a Man doth differ from Creatures of other kindes; ſo he that will teach what the Church is, ſhall never rightly performe the worke whereabout he goeth, till in matter of Religion he touch that difference which ſevereth the Churches Religion from theirs who are not the Church. Religion being therefore a matter partly of contemplation, partly of action, we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine

Now for that the whole Corps of Divinity compriſeth principally two points, <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> I told you I would intreate alſo of God, and of the Church. What hath beene ſaid already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>God,</hi> you haue heard in divers &amp; ſundry Lectures, as alſo in the laſt of all concerning the other point, the <hi>Church.</hi> Wherein being to ſhew vnto you, <hi>Firſt,</hi> what the Church is; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> what ſhee is to Beleeue; <hi>thirdly,</hi> what to Practiſe: and in my laſt Lecture having declared what the Church is, it remaineth that I now ſhew vnto you, what ſhee is chiefly to <hi>Beleeue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Text I haue choſen to this purpoſe is in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Marke's</hi> Goſpell, the fifteenth and ſixteenth verſes. The words are theſe.</p>
            <q>And he ſaid vnto them, Go yee into all the world, and preach the Goſpell to every creature. He that ſhall beleeue, and be baptized, ſhalbe ſaved: but he that will not beleeue, ſhalbe damned.</q>
            <pb n="128" facs="tcp:25448:74"/>
            <p>In which words is comprehended the Iuſtification of the Apoſtle's Miniſtry; in theirs, of all ſuch Paſtors as ſhould ſucceed them to the worlds end, and conſequently of our ſelues. So that <hi>firſt</hi> of all we haue in theſe words the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe, &amp; Author of it, who is our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>And he ſaid vnto them. Secondly,</hi> the parts of that their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, as alſo of our owne, and they are two, Doctrine &amp; Adminiſtration of Sacraments: <hi>Goe yee into all the world, and preach the Gospell to every Creature:</hi> there's the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.

               <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and which in the Booke of <hi>Common Prayer</hi> followeth immediatly the Goſpell. The particulars concerning the Holy Spirit in <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Creed are theſe: <hi>Firſt</hi> that there is one Perſon of the Father, another of the Sonne, and another of the Holy Ghoſt; but the Godhead of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt is all one, the glory equall, the Maieſtie coeternall. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that ſuch as the Father is, ſuch is the Sonne, and ſuch is the Holy Ghoſt, namely vncreate, incomprehenſible, and eternall, &amp; yet not three eternalls, but one, not three incomprehenſibles, but one, not three vncreated, but one. <hi>Thirdly</hi> that as the Father, &amp; the Sonne are both Almightie, both God, both Lord; ſo likewiſe the Holy Ghoſt, &amp; yet not three Almighties but one, nor three Gods but one, nor three Lordes but one. <hi>Fourthly</hi> that the Holy Ghoſt is of the Father, and of the Sonne, neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> that there is one Holy Ghoſt, not three Holy Ghoſts, and that in this Trinitie none is afore, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other, none is greater or leſſer then another; but the whole three Perſons be coeternall together and coequal. That which was declared in the Councel of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> was this: <hi>I beleeue in the Holy Ghoſt, the Lord &amp; giver of life, who proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne, who with the Father and the Sonne together is worſhipped &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, who spake by the Prophets.</hi> And thus much of the firſt part of the Creed inſtructing our Faith concerning GOD.

In the name of the Holy Scriptures we doe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe Canonicall Bookes of the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of whoſe authoritie was never any doubt in the Church. The names and number of them are theſe:
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:25448:91"/> Geneſis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numeri, Deuteronomium Ioſue, Iudges, Ruth, The 1. Booke of Samuel, The 2. Booke of Samuel, The 1. Booke of Kings, The 2. Booke of Kings, The</hi> 1. <hi>Booke of Chronicles, The 2. Booke of Chronicles, The 1. Booke of Eſdras, The 2. Booke of Eſdras, The Booke of Heſter, The Booke of Iob, The Pſalmes, The Proverbs, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes, or the Preacher, Cantica, or Songs of Solomon. The 4 greater Prophets, The 12. leſſe Prophets. And the other Bookes (as Hierome ſaith) the Church doth read for example of life, and inſtruction of manners: but yet doth it not apply them to eſtabliſh any doctrine. Such are theſe following. The third book of Eſdras. The fourth of Eſdras. The booke of Tobias. The booke of Iudith. The reſt of the books of Heſter. The booke of Wiſdome. Ieſus the ſonne of Syrach. Baruch the Prophet. The Song of the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The ſtory of Suſanna. Of Bell and the Dragon. The Prayer of Manaſſes. The 1 Book of Maccabees. The 2 Book of Maccabees. All the Books of the New Teſtament, as they are commonly receiued, we doe receiue and account them Canonicall.</hi> So that we haue in this Article two points to proue. <hi>First,</hi> that the holy Scripture containeth all things neceſſarie (to be knowne and beleeued) for the Salvation of man. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that all the Bookes in the volume of the Bible are not Canonicall, as for example, <hi>Toby, Iudith, Wiſdome, the Sonne of Syrach,</hi> the <hi>Machabees,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For the former we haue both Scriptures and Fathers. Scriptures, as Deut. 4.2, <hi>Yee ſhall put nothing to the Word, which I command you, neither ſhall yee take ought there from.</hi> And Deut. 12.32, <hi>Whatſoever I command yee take heed you doe it: thou ſhalt put nothing thereto, nor take ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</hi> So Ioſhua, 1.7, <hi>Be thou ſtrong &amp; of a moſt valiant cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, that thou maiſt obſerue and doe according to all the law which Moſes my ſervant hath commanded thee: thou ſhalt

Your Democritus he forſooth put out his two eies, &amp; all for he could not looke on a woman, but hee muſt needs luſt after her: a Christian lookes on women with ſafety of eie-ſight enough, and concerning luſt, it is not his eie, it is his hart that is blind only, If I ſhould speake of</hi> CIVILITIE, <hi>I could tell you of Diogenes, that trampled Platoes pride vnder foot, but with a greater pride of his own; a Chriſtian is not prowd, no not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the very poore.

The Text I haue choſen to this purpoſe is out of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Matthewes</hi> Goſpell. Mat. 22. the 37, 38, 39, and 40 verſes. The words be theſe:
<q>Ieſus ſaid to him: Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy ſoule, &amp; with all thy minde. This is the first and the great Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:25448:122"/> And the ſecond is like vnto this, Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe, On theſe two commaundements hangeth the whole Law and the Prophets.</q> The words you ſee are an anſwere, and the anſwere is to a gueſtion, which a certaine Phariſee here made. This Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee it ſhould ſeeme was of the humour of ſome in our daies whoſe queſtioning with their Miniſter is not ſo much to learne, as to try what he can doe, and if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirre not himſelfe the better, to expoſe him to the ſcorne and contempt of ſtanders by.

But to returne vnto my Phariſee. He was, ſaith the Text, <hi>An expounder of the Law,</hi> and ſetting vpon our Saviour in his own proper element, the law, he thought now to ſhew himſelfe ſuch an one therein as that the world ſhould take notice of him that he was the man that put Ieſus to a <hi>Non plus.</hi>

            <p>It is not vnlikely but that he ſtudied the Caſe long before, and all the <hi>Obs,</hi> and all the <hi>Sols,</hi> that might haue beene made to that purpoſe.

            <p>Our Saviours anſwere here vnto him was a good effect of a bad cauſe: for had not the Phariſee here been ſo vicious, we had wanted perhaps this good Inſtruction of <hi>Epitomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing</hi> thus the ten Commandements, nor haue known the <hi>firſt</hi> and great Commandement, <hi>of loving God aboue all,</hi> &amp; how the <hi>ſecond</hi> is like vnto it, <hi>of loving our Neighbours as our ſelues.</hi> Howbeit before we come to this <hi>Epitomizing</hi> of our Saviours, it will not be amiſſe to take a view of each one of them in particular, that ſo having conſidered them one by one, we may make the true benefit of an <hi>Epitome</hi> indeed, which is not therfore made vs, to ſaue vs a labour in reading the larger Volumes, (that would proue the bane of true Learning) but when we haue read them over, to call to our mindes what we haue read, and to treaſure vp the ſumme thereof more firmely in our memories.</p>
            <p>Two ſeverall places there are in holy writ that contain therein theſe Commandements at large, <hi>Exodus,</hi> 20.1. &amp; <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.6. In the booke of <hi>Exodus</hi> they were firſt giuen, in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> they were repeated againe. The reaſon was for that they being dead to whom the Law was given in Mount Sinai (and of that <hi>Exodus</hi> maketh mention) Moſes repeateth the Law againe more particularly in <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:25448:123"/> exhorting and perſwading them to obſerue &amp; keepe the ſame.

            <p>The opinion was wondrous great the Romans had of thoſe Lawes of theirs, which they called the 12 <hi>Tables.</hi> Tully was ſo tranſported with the loue he bare vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that having occaſion to entreat of them, <hi>Fremant omnes licet,</hi>

            <p>There being in the firſt Table then <hi>Foure</hi> Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the ſecond Table <hi>Six,</hi> they are ſpecified to be theſe. The <hi>firſt</hi> of having no other Gods, but the Lord: the <hi>ſecond</hi> of having no Images: the <hi>third</hi> of not taking his name in vaine: the <hi>fourth,</hi> of keeping the Sabboth. And theſe in the firſt Table, the reaſon of the connexion of all which foure, ſeemeth this. The <hi>firſt</hi> teacheth Gods inward worſhip: the <hi>ſecond</hi> his outward: the <hi>third</hi> the reverent vſe of both: the <hi>fourth</hi> the principall time when both are to be done. Thoſe ſix in the ſecond Table are ſpecified to be theſe. The <hi>firſt,</hi> is of honouring our Parents: the <hi>ſecond,</hi> of not killing: the <hi>third,</hi> of not committing adultery: the <hi>fourth,</hi> of not ſtealing: the <hi>fift,</hi> of not bearing falſe witnes: the <hi>ſixt</hi> and laſt, of not coveting. The reaſon of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion ſeemes to be this. In the <hi>firſt</hi> which is the fift Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandement, we are taught ſpeciall duties, and thoſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, as of the Superiour to the Inferiour, and of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the Superiour againe, and that vnder the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of <hi>Honouring Father and Mother.</hi> In the other fiue are contained generall duties, and firſt becauſe life is the ground of al the reſt, therefore in the <hi>firſt</hi> of them, which is the ſixt Commandement, order is taken to preſerue that <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> Secondly becauſe as life muſt be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſo we ought to liue an honeſt life, therefore in the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> of them which is the ſeaventh Commandement, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is taken for that, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adulterie.</hi> Thirdly becauſe an honeſt life muſt be honeſtly maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp; we muſt content our ſelues with what God giues vs, be it little, be it much, in the <hi>third</hi> which is the eight Commandement, we haue a precept concerning that, <hi>Thou ſhalt not steale.</hi> Fourthly for it is not enough to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe our goods in ſuch good ſort, but we muſt haue a care of our good names too, in the <hi>fourth,</hi> which is the ninth Commandement, we are forbidden <hi>To bear falſe witneſſe.</hi> Laſtly, for the heart of Man is the fountaine of all vices, there comming from thence as ſpeakes our Saviour, Mat.

            <p>The ſecond argument taken from that peculiar benefit of his done vnto them, was concerning the land of Egypt out of which he brought them, when as they had beene in bondage there the ſpace of 400 yeeres.</p>

            <q>Thou ſhalt make thee no graven Image, neither any ſimilitude of things that are in heaven aboue, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that are the in earth beneath, nor that are in the waters vnder the earth.

            <p>There are in this ſecond Commandement three eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and principal parts. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Precept it ſelfe: <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> a menacing of thoſe that worſhip him otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he will: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> a promiſe vnto ſuch as worſhip him aright.

            <p>Concerning the former point of Images not to be made, I therefore adde, <hi>to worſhip God withall,</hi> for that <hi>Sanders</hi> in his Treatiſe of <hi>worſhipping of Images,</hi> hath a whole Chapter, the contents whereof is, <hi>That the word of God forbiddeth not generally the making of all kinde of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and in what ſenſe Images are forbidden to be made:</hi> wherevnto you ſhall haue the Anſwer of that worthy <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> of ours D.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:25448:128"/> by the ſecond Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement expreſly forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we may cleerly perceiue, what Images are forbidden to be made, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that this is a Precept of the firſt Table, which concerneth Religion. Therefore by it we are forbidden to make our ſelues any maner of Images for any vſe of Religion.</hi> Now that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ought not to be made to worſhippe God withall, we haue divers and ſundry <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as Deut. 4.15.

Come we now to our Saviours <hi>Epitome</hi> of them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of but in a word. <hi>Ieſus ſaid vnto him: Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy ſoule, and with all thy mind. This is the first and the great Commandement. And the ſecond is like vnto this. Thou ſhalt loue thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelfe. On theſe two Commandements hangeth the whole Law and the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Tenne are reduced to two, it is becauſe the <hi>foure</hi> Commandements that are in the firſt Table are reduced to <hi>One,</hi> and the <hi>Six</hi> Commandements in the ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reduced to an <hi>Other.</hi> Firſt concerning the Foure.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Foure</hi> may be reduced to <hi>One,</hi> it muſt be done by ſuch a meanes, as all the <hi>Foure</hi> are capable of, &amp; alſo that <hi>One.</hi> By that which hath beene ſaid it doth appeare that the ſoule (as it were) of the foure Commandements, that are in the firſt Table, is the <hi>Loue of God,</hi> I meane that loue wherewith we ought to loue him. So that if we loue him is we ought, that is with all our <hi>heart,</hi> with all our <hi>ſoule,</hi> and with all our <hi>minde,</hi> then ſhal we haue <hi>no other Gods but
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:25448:139"/> him,</hi> and this is an inward worſhip, &amp; this is the <hi>firſt</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. If we loue him as we ought, that is, with all our <hi>heart,</hi> with all our <hi>ſoule,</hi> and with al our <hi>minde,</hi> then as we worſhip him inwardly in our heart, ſo ſhall we doe it outwardly in our actions, and not impart it vnto <hi>Images,</hi> and this is the <hi>ſecond</hi> Commandement. If we loue him as we ought, that is, with all our <hi>heart,</hi> with all our <hi>ſoule,</hi> and withall our <hi>minde,</hi> then will we reverently vſe theſe two worſhips, the inward, and the outward, and this is the <hi>third</hi> Commandement. Laſtly, if we loue God as we ought, that is, with all our <hi>heart,</hi> with all our <hi>ſoule,</hi> &amp; with all our mind, then ſhall we haue ſpeciall deſire to keep his <hi>Sabboths,</hi> and this is the fourth Commandement. So that the Loue of God being all in all, you ſee what cauſe our Saviour had to reduce all <hi>Foure</hi> to <hi>One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſelfe ſame cauſe he had to reduce the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her <hi>Six</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an <hi>Other,</hi> for as the <hi>Loue of God</hi> in the firſt Table was al in all, ſo in the ſecond, the <hi>loue of our Neighbour.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Apoſtle S. Paule, <hi>Owe nothing</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 13.8.</note> ſaith he, <hi>to any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but to Loue one an other: for he that loveth an other hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou ſhalt not commit adultery, Thou ſhalt not kil, Thou ſhalt not ſteale, Thou ſhalt not beare falſe witnes, Thou ſhalt not covet: and if there be any other commandement, it is briefly comprehended in this ſaying, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this, Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi> Nor wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our Saviour the very words of Scripture it ſelfe to countenance this Diviſion. For where he ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy ſoule, &amp; with all thy minde,</hi> it is with a little alteration ſet cleerely downe, Deut. 6.5. &amp; the other, <hi>Thou ſhalt loue thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelfe,</hi> that is ſet downe without any alteration, even in as many ſillables, Levit. 19.18.</p>
            <p>The only obſervation I will giue you now, and ſo an end, is concerning the <hi>Loue of our Neighbours</hi> thus graced by our Saviour. You ſee in what account it is with God, &amp; therefore in what it is to be with Men. <hi>Did</hi> he giue but
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:25448:139"/> ten Commandements in all? No leſſe then ſixe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne our Neighbour. <hi>Did</hi> he afterwards contract them into two?
